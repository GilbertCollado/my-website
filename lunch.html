      <h2>Where to Eat Lunch</h2>
      <p>In the Dominican Republic, lunch isn’t just eaten at home. Many locals grab a quick meal from street vendors, market stalls, or comedores — small, family-run restaurants that serve hearty plates at affordable prices.</p>
      <p>Office workers often dine out during extended lunch breaks, while schools and universities adjust their schedules to allow students to go home for lunch. This reflects the cultural importance of sharing this meal with family and friends.</p>
