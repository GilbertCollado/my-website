      <p>Dominican breakfasts are designed to be filling, flavorful, and full of cultural pride. Families often start their mornings with a hot plate of Tres Golpes or hearty cornmeal porridge.</p>
      <p>Breakfast is commonly enjoyed at home, but many local eateries (called “comedores”) also serve traditional morning dishes, especially on weekends.</p>
      <p>Dominican coffee, dark, strong, and sweet, is almost always part of the breakfast experience, often served with a small piece of bread or cheese on the side.</p>

      <h2>Traditional Morning Beverages</h2>
      <p>Dominicans take pride in their morning beverages. A strong cup of Dominican coffee, usually brewed in a greca (stovetop coffee maker), is a daily essential. It’s rich, bold, and often sweetened generously with sugar.</p>
      <p>In rural areas, hot chocolate made from local cacao is also popular — often served with a piece of buttered bread or cassava. Fresh tropical juices like passionfruit (chinola), papaya (lechosa), and orange are commonly enjoyed as refreshing morning drinks.</p>
